Unusual Incidents Unit Rescue Squad, or UIU for short is a different take on MTF.
During a MTF Respawn Wave there is a 33% chance that UIU spawns instead.
UIU is meant to be an anti scp only group, but due to limitations, they are stronger MTF.
UIU has the same 3 levels of positions as MTF, with each position having different effects.

UIU Leader (MTF Captian): Spawns with 130 HP, Spawns with a Facility Manager Keycard, ADATS*, Silent Serenade*, Medkit, Adrenline, Radio, Grenade, Heavy Armor.
UIU Agent (MTF Sargent): Spawns with 120 HP, Spawns with an AK, Medkit, Adrenline, Radio, PB-42*, C4*, Combat Armor
UIU Solider (MTF Private): Spawns with 110 HP, Spawns with a MTF Sargent Keycard, AK, Medkit, Adrenline, Radio, Flash Bang, Grenade, Combat Armor

UIU Spawns at the Escape Hall. Only one UIU Spawnwave can happen per game.

* Denotes Custom Items, and you should read that section to understand the custom items these guys spawn with.

This is a joke role that is rewarded to anyone who says "I didn't read the Server Info" or say anything on the lines that admits that they haven't read it.
Other statements to obtain this role are as follows
	"Why isn't the round ending with Chaos and SCPs"
	"Why isnt my 'grenade' going off?" (It's C4 dum dum)
	"Why did my LMG/Logister fire Grenades?" OR "Why can't I reload this LMG/Logister" (It's an ADATS, you need a grenade, it tells you this)
	(Other examples here)

SCP SL Specifics:
  Containment Engineer Scientist can no longer escape to become an MTF member. 
    The ability to open 106s or 096s room without needing to get a card first is a bit strong (granted its easy to get it anyways but still)
    The description of the Containment Engineer has been updated to incude that fact
    Containment Engineer Scientist can still defect to the Chaos Insergency and become a memeber of the Chaos Insurgency
  Telepathic Chaos can now detect all foes to the Chaos Insurgency (SCPs, SH)
    Lets be real for the one upside there was basically no benifits as when it spawns in all (or close to all) foundation memebers are dead
  The Detect Ability will no longer show you code for finding hostiles near you, instead it will properly show you the role (minus UIU as it uses MTF as a base)

  All Custom Roles that has an active ability now shows different activation messages
    Exiled.CustomRoles is super weird so it eats abilities that has information that needs to be displayed
    (This hopefully doesnt affect how they work)

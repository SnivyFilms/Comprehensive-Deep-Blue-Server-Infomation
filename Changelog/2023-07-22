SCP:SL Specfic:
	Custom Escapes added.
		D-Class, Detained MTF Members & Scienists should go by the CI Van door
		Scientists, Detained D-Class and Chaos should go by the normal escape hall
	Nerfed the Autogun range to "10." Assuming that the range is distance in meters, 10 is just slightly shorter than SCP-173's range in breakneck speed.
	Buffed the Autogun damage to 20 (was 10), to give a use if you actually have it at close range instead of a regular gun.
		Thank sunky for talking about how stupid it was.

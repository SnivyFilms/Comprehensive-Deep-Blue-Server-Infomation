SCP SL Specifics.
	Updated Exiled Again
		Should fixed the issue of SCPs and Chaos winning if the 25% alive freshhold hasnt been met
			Should translate easily to the 0% alive for SH
	Updated Map Editor Reborn
	You are now able to SCP Swap to SCP 3114 with .scpswap 3114 (more versions of that coming soon)
		I wasn't lying when I said soon, as its the next line. Other options to swap to SCP 3114 is .scpswap skelton and .scpswap guitar riff
		I intend on leaving the ability to SCP Swap 3114 in the game year around
	Updated SCP Info Display so that SCP 3114 shows up in there
		Side update, I have given SCPs custom names with it. Some are far more creative than others, this will be reverted at the end of the Halloween event

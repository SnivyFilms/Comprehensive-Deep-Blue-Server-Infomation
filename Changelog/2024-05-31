SCP SL Specifics:
  (This is a few days worth of backlogged stuff)
  SCP-939's health on kill has been reduced from 300 to 100, which maybe reduced further in the future
  SCP-096 has a damage reduction towards MicroHID, (basically 096 has effective 7000 HP towards a micro usage)
  An Anti Void plugin has been installed, this should fix the occasional spawn of someone getting stuck in the void at the beginning of the season

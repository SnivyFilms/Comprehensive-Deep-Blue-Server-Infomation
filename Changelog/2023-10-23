SCP SL Specifics
	AutoEvents (the minigame plugin) actually works with the most recent update (I messed something up in the config file that wouldnt load the maps)
	Updated SCP Info Display to its latest version.
		SCP Info Display should follow this fashion
		You (In yellow)
		SCP Name (In red)
		HP/Generators (In green, +1 in red for activating generators)
		Hume Shield/Access Tier (In blue)
		Zombie Count/Energy Level/Vigor (In pink)

		HP now shows the direct value and not a percentage.

SCP:SL Specifics.
	I have coded a new custom role. (This took a lot of effort)
	Containment Engineer.
		A Scientist that spawns in enterance zone with a Containment Engineer keycard, Medkit, Adreline, and a Radio.
		This is due to be reworked eventually.
		I'll add the info about the Containment Engineer to the hint system eventually.

	If anyone has any ideas for a new custom role, especially for guard, make a suggestion in the suggestion forums.

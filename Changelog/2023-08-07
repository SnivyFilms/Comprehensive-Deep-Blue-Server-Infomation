A fair amount of stuff here.
SCP:SL Specifics.
	Added Protocol Enforcer.
		A Facility Guard that spawns in Light Containment, with a tranquilzer, 10 reserve rounds. Only has a Zone Manager Keycard so they can't bomb rush the armory. ~20% Chance to spawn as this type of guard.
		Credit to Gabgorgan for the inital idea.
	Added Biochemist
		A Scientists that spawns in Light Containment, no keycard, but has altered stats. ~20% Chance to spawn as this type of scientist.
			Stats:
			110 HP
			The ability to passively heal others
			Dies with PASSION!
	Edited Serpents Hand
		HP 120 -> 100
		Due to how the plugin was updated, friendly fire between SCPs and Serpents Hand is now possible **AND CANNOT CURRENTLY BE DISABLED**
		I really don't know how the ninja HP change got by me until I saw it in game a bit ago.
		If there is enough reason to change it back I can set the HP back to 120
		Team Kill as Serpents Hand is now possible
	Edited UIU Rescue Squad:
		**HOPEFULLY** these guys spawn in with the ammo for their main guns. (I have no idea what's causing this, and when it's spawned in manually they have their ammo)
	Added custom role hints to respawn timer for Protocol Enforcer and Biochemist
	Fixed minor spelling mistakes in respawn timer hints.
	Updated the server info in game to have more rules because I know people are lazy.

GitHub Specifics.
	Updated Custom Roles (SCP SL Specifics -> Plugins -> Tutorial -> Custom Roles) to have the new roles in there
	Updated Unusual Incidents Unit Rescue Squad (SCP SL Specifics -> Plugins -> Tutorial -> Custom Roles) to match what happens in game
	Added Non Staff in the Administration Layer
		The following roles has been moved from Staff to Non Staff
			Ethics Committee Broadcaster
			Ethics Committee Member (VIP)
			Ethics Committee Plugin Helper
			I don't read server info's. Please laugh at me! (I don't read server infos in the GitHub)
			I waste my money on discord boosts.
	Edited Ethics Committee Broadcaster (Administration Layer -> Non Staff -> Ethics Committee Broadcaster) to have how you can obtain the role
	Edited I don't read server infos (Administration Layer -> Non Staff -> I don't read server infos) to have more examples on how you can obtain the role.
	Removed old, unused plugins from the Plugins list (SCP SL Specifics -> Plugins -> Plugins)

Discord Specifics.
	Anyone who has the following roles, Ethics Committee Broadcaster, Ethics Committee Member (VIP), and Ethics Committee Plugin Helper, now has access to a special secret area. If you have these roles check it out on the discord
	Added "Allgemein" voice channel, which is quite literally german for General
	Increased the bitrate for General and Allgemein to the highest level
	Added "The Xbox Live Experience" voice channel, this is a voice channel that is set to the lowest possible bitrate, this is a joke VC.

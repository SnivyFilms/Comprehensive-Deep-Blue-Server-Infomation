SCP SL Specifics
  Removed Smoke Grenade Plugin
    This doesn't mean the custom item has been removed
  Added Snivy's Custom Items Plugin
    This is the Smoke Grenade's Custom Item new home
    (WIP) Explosive Round Revolver, using a revolver, where ever the bullet lands, spawns a grenade with a shorter than normal fuse
      This isn't an explode immediately, as it would just become a better ADATS, as it lacks the flaws of the ADATS.
        Such as the arch of the grenade, the impact on the wall, etc. as where ever the bullet lands the grenade spawns
      Currently this is a custom item that can only be given by admin command
    (WIP) Nerve Agent Grenade
      When detonated it makes a smoke cloud for a short time, being near this cloud will inflict 1 damage a second, and giving the posioned effect for how ever long you're near the cloud + 30 seconds
      Currently this is a custom item that can only be given by admin command
  LJ-429 now has a blue name, like how the previous LJ-119 had.
  Health on kill values has been altered for SCPs
    SCP-939: 100 -> 25
    SCP-096: 300 -> 100
    SCP-049: 400 -> 200
    SCP-173: 300 (Unchanged)
    SCP-106: 0 (Unchanged)
    SCP-3114: 0 (Unchanged)
    This is due to the stream that happened really showing that if an SCP can combo players, they basically heal all the damage that is taken.
    Further changes is on the table.

SCP:SL Specifics
	Nuke Lock is gone, it was incredibly janky especially with radiation posioning with SCP-106 being able to out attrition the humans

	Added Post Nuke Surface Tweaks, the radiation is much better, being able to configure effects, and set how much damage SCPs takes over Humans (Example, humans take 2 damage, SCPs take 50), goes straight through Hume Shield as well.

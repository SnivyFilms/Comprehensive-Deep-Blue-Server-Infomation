Discord Specifics:
  Added a plugins-update channel.
  This is where all plugins that I currently maintain, the big ones being Serpents Hand and UIU Rescue Squad will have updates pushed to.
  This will only really benifit the people who are interested at looking under the hood for how things like this work.

Part 2:
SCP SL Specifics:
  Updated Serpents Hand to a beta release.
  Includes 2 new SH roles to match the 3 roles that MTF, CI, and UIU has.
  Other refences hasn't been updated yet to include those.
  Name feedback would be greatly appricated

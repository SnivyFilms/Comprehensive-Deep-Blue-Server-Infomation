SCP SL Specifics.
  Any role that is a "tutorial" (So Tutorials for staff related purposes, Serpents Hand, and SCP-035) can no longer enrage SCP-096
  This change was done to reduce the amount of accidental friendly fire and forcing 096 to not be able to see other users (if they rage)
  PostNukeTweaks has been updated, radiation is back (meaning that 106 can totally camp again yes totally, totally didnt put in a counter play for 106 campers)

  Possibly adding non guaranteed item spawns throughout surface. Referencing this: https://discord.com/channels/1066497426946531348/1153434781648945262/1153434781648945262
    This is going to be an interesting balancing situation, we will have to see how it goes.
  Still working on a Chaos Custom Role that spawns with pink candy. No I havent forgotten about it, still figuring out how to give pink candy. Referecing this: https://discord.com/channels/1066497426946531348/1136066052808261642/1136068600814370936

SCP:SL Specifics
	D-Class Dwarf has been nerfed, 100 HP to 75 HP.
		The reason for this is that the D-CLass Dwarf is effectively a straight upgrade that someone is guaranteed to spawn with, with unlimited sprint and a smaller hitbox, it was hard to pin down for a second especially for gun weilding players.
	UIU Rescue Squad has a slightly different spawn layout now.
		Instead of spawning all on top of eachother during a UIU Respawn Wave they have a littlebit of a spread.

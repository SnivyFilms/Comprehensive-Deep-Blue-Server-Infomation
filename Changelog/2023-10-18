SCP SL Specifics:
  Nerfed the FR-MG-0 in multiple ways.
    1. It is no longer a guarantee to spawn with it as the MTF Captain
    2. You can no longer create it with the E11SR on Fine in 914
      2a. A E11SR now makes an AK on fine
    3. You can make it with an E11SR on Very Fine
      3a. E11SR on very fine can give: Crossvec, 30%, AK, 25%, Logicer, 20%, Shotgun, 10%, FR-MG-0, 10%, MircoHID, 5%
      3b. Normally its Crossvec, 30%, AK, 30%, Logicer, 25%, Shotgun, 10%, MicroHID, 5%
    4. The damage has been reduced by 20%. Don't worry it can still melt heavy armor players in less than a second
  This is basically due to Northwood not actually being able to balance their game so Ill do it instead
